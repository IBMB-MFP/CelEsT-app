# CelEsT-app
Shiny app for performing TF activity estimation in C. elegans with the CelEsT Gene Regulatory Network and the decoupleR package

Download the repository (click on the drop down arrow on the green 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP'), unzip it and run the app.R file from within R using the runApp() function in the 'shiny' package or by opening the file and using the 'Run App' button within 'R Studio'.

The first time the app runs on the local machine it should install all necessary packages. This may take a few minutes.
